## Coworking times (optional)

Coworking sessions are where get our own work done at the same time
together. Sometimes, this means quiet work with check-ins to break up
focused work and get feedback, and sometimes this involves asking
questions and screensharing to learn and problem solve. We will make
breakout rooms in Zoom so people working on related themes can meet and
learn from each other.

Participants across all three Fall 2024 NMFS Openscapes Champions
Cohorts are welcome and encouraged to join a Coworking session in the
weeks between Cohort Calls.

**Date-Times:**   
Tuesdays and Thursdays 12:00 -1:00 pm PT every second
week: Oct 15, 17, 29\*, 31, Nov 12, 14, 26, 28.   
\*Tuesday Oct 29 will be 11:00 - 12:00 PT.

- [**Our path to better science in less time using open data science
  tools**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160) (Lowndes et
  al. 2017) - This describes a marine science team’s transition to open
  collaborative teamwork. It was the original inspiration for creating
  the Champions Program and heavily influences the Core Lessons. We’ll
  ask that everyone participating reads it before our first Cohort Call.
- [**Supercharge your research: a ten-week plan for open data science**](https://openscapes.github.io/supercharge-research/) (Lowndes et
  al. 2019) - This was co-authored with the inaugural Champions Cohort,
  capturing the most valuable take-aways for marine and environmental
  science early career faculty.

  Open Science**](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.11341) (Lowndes

  organizations – including NASA Earthdata, NOAA Fisheries, EPA,
  California Water Boards, Pathways to Open Science, Fred Hutch Cancer
  Center.
